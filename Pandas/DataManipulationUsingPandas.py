The three phases of data manipulation :: 
1) Data Preparation
2) Data Transformation
3) Data Aggregation


# Data Preparation
==============================================================================================================================
Before you start manipulating data, it is necessary to prepare the data and assemble them in the form of data structures such 
that they can be manipulated later with the tools made available by the pandas library.

The different procedures for data preparation are :: 
a) Loading
b) assembling
    • Merging 
    • Concatenating
    • Combining
    
c) Reshaping (pivoting)
d) Removing

We will see how to perform all the operations necessary to get the data into a unified data structure.

# Merging ::
The merging operation, which corresponds to the JOIN operation consists of a combination of data through the connection of 
rows using one or more keys
